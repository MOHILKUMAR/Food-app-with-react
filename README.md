📋 Project Brief: Food App with React
🧾 Overview
The Food App is a modern, responsive web application built using React.js, designed to provide users with a seamless experience of browsing various food items and managing their cart. It fetches food data from an external API and allows users to explore menus, view details, and add items to their cart.

🎯 Project Objectives
Create an interactive UI for a food delivery or restaurant browsing platform.

Use React to build a component-based, maintainable front-end.

Implement dynamic routing for better user experience.

Fetch data from a live API to simulate real-world applications.

Use state management to handle cart operations and data flow.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React.js

Routing: React Router DOM

State Management: React's useState and useContext (or Redux if added later)

Styling: CSS (can be enhanced with Tailwind or Material UI)

API: Swiggy’s public API (or mocked JSON)

Build Tool: Vite (if used) or Create React App

🧩 Core Features
🍽️ Home Page – Displays restaurant listings and food categories.

📄 Restaurant Menu Page – Shows the menu of a selected restaurant with food item details.

🛒 Cart Page – Manages selected items with quantity updates and removal option.

🔄 Dynamic Routing – Navigates between pages like home, restaurant, and cart.

⚡ API Integration – Fetches restaurant and food data dynamically.

🧠 Stateful UI – Manages cart and menu using React hooks.

🔄 Possible Improvements
Add authentication (login/signup)

Integrate payment gateway

Add filters and search functionality

Use Redux Toolkit or Context API for global state

Add animations with Framer Motion

Improve mobile responsiveness and UI polish

📌 Conclusion
The Food App with React is a practical project to demonstrate your front-end development skills, especially in React, routing, API integration, and component architecture. It's scalable and can evolve into a full-fledged food delivery app with backend and authentication.
